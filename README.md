This repository provides the source code for the ICLR'23 paper **Molecular Geometry Pretraining with SE(3)-Invariant Denoising Distance Matching**, with the following task:
- During pre-training, we consider pure 3D geometric information.
- During downstream, we consider tasks with 3D geometry/conformation only.
